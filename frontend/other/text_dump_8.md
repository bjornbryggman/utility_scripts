Okay, let's move on to step 9 of the action plan: Optimization and Refactoring.

**Optimization Strategies:**

1. **Profiling:**
   - Use a profiling tool like `cProfile` or `line_profiler` to identify performance bottlenecks in your code.
   - Run your code with a representative set of input files and analyze the profiling results to pinpoint areas for optimization.

2. **Database Optimizations:**
   - **Batch Operations:** Instead of performing individual database operations for each property or value, consider using batch operations to improve performance, especially when dealing with large datasets.
   - **Indexing:** Ensure that you have appropriate indexes on the database tables to speed up queries.
   - **Query Optimization:** Analyze your database queries and optimize them for efficiency.

3. **Code Optimizations:**
   - **Regular Expression Optimization:** If you're using regular expressions extensively, analyze their performance and consider optimizing them for efficiency.
   - **Data Structures:** Choose data structures that are appropriate for the task and optimize for performance. For example, use dictionaries for fast lookups instead of lists.
   - **Avoid Unnecessary Operations:** Eliminate redundant calculations or operations to improve performance.

4. **Multiprocessing:**
   - Utilize multiprocessing to parallelize tasks that can be executed independently, such as file processing or database operations.

**Refactoring Strategies:**

1. **Code Structure:**
   - Refactor your code to improve readability and maintainability.
   - Consider using functions to encapsulate related logic and classes to organize your code.
   - Break down large functions into smaller, more manageable units.

2. **Naming Conventions:**
   - Use clear and descriptive variable and function names.
   - Follow consistent naming conventions.

3. **Code Style:**
   - Adhere to a consistent coding style, such as PEP 8 for Python.
   - Use a code formatter like `black` to automatically format your code.

**Example Optimization (Database Batch Operations):**

```python
# Instead of individual operations:
# with Session(engine) as session:
#     for value in values:
#         original_value = OriginalValue(property_id=property_record.id, value=value)
#         session.add(original_value)
#     session.commit()

# Use batch operations:
with Session(engine) as session:
    original_values = [OriginalValue(property_id=property_record.id, value=value) for value in values]
    session.add_all(original_values)
    session.commit()
```

**Example Refactoring (Function Encapsulation):**

```python
# Before refactoring:
def calculate_scaling_factors(original_values, scaled_values):
    scaling = {}
    for prop in original_values:
        # ... calculation logic ...
    return scaling

# After refactoring:
def calculate_scaling_factors(original_values, scaled_values):
    scaling = {}
    for prop in original_values:
        scaling[prop] = _calculate_property_scaling(original_values[prop], scaled_values[prop])
    return scaling

def _calculate_property_scaling(original_prop_values, scaled_prop_values):
    # ... calculation logic ...
    return scaling_factor

def scale_positional_values(
    input_directory: Path, output_directory: Path, input_format: str, resolution: str
) -> None:
    """
    Scales relevant positional values in text files according to a specified scaling factor.

    This function reads text files from the input directory, applies a scaling factor to
    specific positional attributes, and writes the modified content to the output directory.

    Args:
    ----
    - input_directory (Path): The directory containing the GUI files to process.
    - output_directory (Path): The directory to output processed files.
    - input_format (str): The file extension of input GUI files (e.g., 'xml', 'ui').
    - resolution (str): The target resolution (e.g., "2K", "4K").

    Returns:
    -------
    - None

    Raises:
    ------
    - FileNotFoundError: If no images are found in the input directory.
    - ValueError: If an invalid scaling factor is provided.
    - Exception: If an unexpected error occurs.
    """
    log.info("Scaling positional values in text files for %s resolution...", resolution)

    try:
        # Use a ProcessPoolExecutor to run the worker function in parallel.
        input_files = list(input_directory.rglob(f"*.{input_format.lower()}"))
        with ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=multiprocessing.cpu_count()) as executor:
            for input_file in input_files:
                # Scale file contents
                scaled_content = scale_file_contents(input_file, resolution)

                if scaled_content is not None:
                    # Calculate the relative output path to maintain directory structure.
                    relative_path = input_file.relative_to(input_directory)
                    output_path = output_directory / relative_path.parent

                    # Write the scaled content to the output file
                    output_path.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
                    output_file = output_path / input_file.name
                    file_utils.write_file(output_file, scaled_content)
                    log.debug("Updated %s with scaled values.", output_file.name)

                else:
                    log.debug("No changes have been made to %s.", input_file.name)

    except FileNotFoundError as error:
        log.exception(
            "No %s files found in %s.",
            input_format.upper(),
            input_directory,
            exc_info=error)
        sys.exit()
    except ValueError as error:
        log.exception("Invalid scaling factor.", exc_info=error)
        sys.exit()
    except Exception as error:
        log.exception("An unexpected error occurred.", exc_info=error)
```

**Next Steps:**

1. **Profile your code:** Identify performance bottlenecks.
2. **Implement optimizations:** Apply the strategies mentioned above to improve performance.
3. **Refactor your code:** Improve readability, maintainability, and structure.

By optimizing and refactoring your code, you can significantly improve the performance and maintainability of your scaling solution.
