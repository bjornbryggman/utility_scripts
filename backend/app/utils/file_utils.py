Provides a collection of utility functions for file I/O, directory management, and YAML processing.

This module offers a variety of utility functions that can be used across the project. It includes
functions for reading and writing files, creating and deleting directories, encoding and decoding
images as base64 strings, and working with YAML data.

These functions aim to provide a centralized and reusable set of tools for common file and data
manipulation tasks.
